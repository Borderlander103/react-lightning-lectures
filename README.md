# React Lightning Lectures

A series of short (5-15 minute) lessons on React and JS topics.
These are intended to provide a deeper dive into some of the nuts and bots, high-level concepts, and best practices of React.

Each topic is contained in its own branch. They include a notes file explaining the topic and a simple demo app showing the concept.
Though they are designed as lectures, the notes, along with exploring the demo, should be sufficient to explain the topic.

## Topics

### Best Practices

**anonymous-render-funcs**

Why you should not use anonymous functions inside a component's `render()` method

**constructor-funcs**

Why you usually do not need to use a constructor function inside a class component

### Demo Set-up

This project was set-up using `create-react-app`. To run it follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

2. Clone the project down

3. In a terminal window, navigate to the project folder and then run `npm install`

4. Once the packages have been installed, run `git checkout <insert_topic_branch_name>` for the topic you are interested in

5. Run `npm run start` and the project will be running at `http://localhost:3000`
