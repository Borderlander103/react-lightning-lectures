# React Lightning Lectures

A series of short (5-15 minute) lessons on React and JS topics.
These are intended to provide a deeper dive into some of the nuts and bots, high-level concepts, and best practices of React.

Each topic has its own branch. They include a notes file explaining the topic and a simple demo app showing the concept.
Though they are designed as lectures, the notes, along with exploring the demo, should be sufficient to explain the topic.
